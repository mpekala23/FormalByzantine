# Formal Byzantine

This repo is an exploratory dive into the Lean theorem prover, using it to verify the proof of the Byzantine Generals Problem. Alongside the verification in `src/final.lean`, a paper is presented outlining the problem, it's proof, and the learnings I took away from trying to verify this complicated result in Lean.
